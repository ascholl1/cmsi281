To run:
Compile first, obviously.

Then,
java Trie <clintonSpeech.txt
OR
java Trie <trumpSpeech.txt
(whichever you wan to see results for)

The output you should expect is a numbered list of the most common words, with the frequency of each word below it. I chose certain words not to count, and those words are: a, and, of, to, that, is, in, for, are, from, it, with, were, what, on, out, this, its, and the. I stopped at that because I came to find out that barely any words we use actually mean anything.

I also chose to print out the top 20 most common words just because I wanted to see more. So yeah.
